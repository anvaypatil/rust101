### Basics of Program
- [Built-in Macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/#macros) `` macro_name ! ( );``
- What are macros used for? 
  They are used in metaprogramming, i.e., code that writes code. They look like functions in other system programming languages like C and C++, but instead of generating a function call like functions, they are expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program. In this way, they provide more run-time features.
- Last-line of the method can have optional semi-colon in the end.  


### Basic formatting
- Single Placeholders
```rust
  println!("Number: {}", 1);
```
- Multiple Placeholders
```rust
    println!("{} is a {} girl", "Jane", "good");
```
- Positional Arguments
```rust
 println!("Enhance your coding skills from {0} courses.  {0} courses are very {1}", "Educative", "interactive");
```
- Named Arguments
```rust
 println!("{company} provides {kind} courses", company = "Educative", kind = "interactive");
```
- Placeholder Traits
``{:b} - binary ,{:x} - hexadecimal, {:o} - octal``
```rust
  println!("Number : 10 \nBinary:{:b} Hexadecimal:{:x} Octal:{:o}", 10, 10, 10);
  // 10 + 10 = 20
```
- Basic expression formatting
```rust
  println!("{} + {} = {}",10, 10, 10 + 10);
```
- Placeholder for a Debug Trait
```rust
  // You can use a debug trait and write as many values as desired within the parentheses.
  // This prevents having to write placeholders for each value.
  // {:?} is implemented via debug trait and can have limitation example `i32` array can be printed 
  //  if have more than 32 elements
  println!("{:?}", ("This is a Rust Course", 101));
  // ("This is a Rust Course", 101)
  // this is for pretty print
  println!("{:#?}", ("This is a Rust Course", 101));
```


### Printing Styles
- print!() `macro simply prints the output to the console.`
- println!() `macro appends a new line at the end of the string.`
- eprint!() `macro displays the output as an error.`
- eprintln!() `macro displays the output as an error and appends a new line(\n) at the end of it.`


### Comments
- Line Comments
```rust
// line comment
```
- Block Comments
```rust
/*
 Block comment
*/
```
- Doc Comments
```rust
/// This is a Outer Doc comment outside the function
/// Generate docs for the following item.
/// This shows my code outside a module or a function
fn main() {
    //! This a Inner doc comment that is inside the function   
    //! This comment shows my code inside a module or a function  
    //! Generate docs for the enclosing item
    println!("{} can support {} notation","Doc comment","markdown");
}
```

- memory print
```rust
use std::mem;
fn main(){
   let xs = [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
   println!("{} {} {}", xs[0], xs.len(), mem::size_of_val(&xs));                    
}
```
