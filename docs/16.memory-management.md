### Stack vs Heap
- Stack
    - When the size of data is known at compile-time, a stack is used for storage.
- Heap
    - When the size of data is not known at compile time rather it is known at the run time, it goes in a portion of program memory called a heap.

### Rust Stack and heap handling
When we want to allocate anything on heap we can use `Box::new()`. 
By default, except some structures like `String` and `Vec`, which are meant for dynamic growth, they are heap allocated.
