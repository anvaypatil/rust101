### Variables
- All variables are immutable by default.
- `let` is used to create binding
- `let langauge="Rust"` Initialize variable.
- `let mut langauge="Rust"` making variable mutable.
- `let (course,category) =("Rust","beginner");` assigning multiple variables.


### Scope 
- Scope of variable is inside the {} of it being declared. 
### Shadowing
- Variable shadowing is a technique in which a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This is also known as masking.


```rust
fn main(){
    let a = 123;
    let b = {
        let b = 89;
        println!("{} -> {}", a, b);
        b
    };
    println!("{} -> {}", a, b);
}
// 123 -> 89
// 123 -> 89
```

#### Declaring constants & static
- One can create a global constant at any level from Mod Level till function level
- when we try to modify `static` variable and try to re-assign value, we need to put under `unsafe` block

```rust
const GLOBAL_LOCK: i8 = 4;
static mut STATIC_LOCK: i32 = 89;

fn main() {
    static mut B: i32 = 89;
    unsafe {
        B = 90;
        STATIC_LOCK = 800;
        println!("{} -> {}", B, STATIC_LOCK);
        println!("{} ->", GLOBAL_LOCK);
    }
}
```
