### Variables
- All variables are immutable by default.
- `let` is used to create binding
- `let langauge="Rust"` Initialize variable.
- `let mut langauge="Rust"` making variable mutable.
- `let (course,category) =("Rust","beginner");` assigning multiple variables.


### Scope 
- Scope of variable is inside the {} of it being declared. 
### Shadowing
- Variable shadowing is a technique in which a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This is also known as masking.
