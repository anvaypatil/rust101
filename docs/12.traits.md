### Traits
- multiple different types behind a single interface
- They are like interfaces in Java.

### Types of Methods in Traits
There can be two types of methods in traits
- Concrete Method
  - The method that has a body meaning that implementation of the method is done within the method.
- Abstract Method
    - The method that does not have a body meaning that implementation of the method is done by each struct in its own impl construct.


```rust
fn main(){
   //create an instance of the structure
   let c = Circle  {
      radius : 2.0,
   };
   let r = Rectangle  {
      width : 2.0,
      height : 2.0,
   };
   println!("Area of Circle: {}", c.shape_area());
   println!("Area of Rectangle:{}", r.shape_area());
}
//declare a structure
struct Circle {
   radius : f32,
}
struct Rectangle{
    width : f32,
    height : f32,
}
//declare a trait
trait Area {
   fn shape_area(&self)->f32;
}
//implement the trait
impl Area for Circle {
   fn shape_area(&self)->f32{
      3.13* self.radius *self.radius
   }
}
impl Area for Rectangle {
   fn shape_area(&self)->f32{
      self.width * self.height
   }
}

impl fmt::Display for Rectangle {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter)-> fmt::Result{
        write!(f, "(Width: {}, Height: {})", self.width, self.height)
    }
}
```
