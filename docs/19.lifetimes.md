### Lifetime in Rust
- The borrow checker always evaluate the lifetime of a variable. However if we want to extend the lifetime beyond the default we use lifetime scoping.
```rust
fn pr<'a>(x:&'a str, y: &'a str)-> &'a str{
    let a = "hello";
    a
}
fn main() {
    let a = "a string";
    let b = "b string";
    let c = pr(a,b);
    println!("{}",c);
}
``` 
- Lifetime in struct
```rust
struct A<'a,'b> {
    x:&'a str,
    y:&'b str,
}
impl <'a, 'b> A<'a, 'b> {
    fn item(&self)-> &str{
        self.x
    }
}
fn main() {
    let a = A {x:"Hello", y:"There"};
    let s: &'static str = "The string";
}
```
